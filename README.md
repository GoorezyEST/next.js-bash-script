# A script to facilitate the creation of an application in Next.js

I have been developing projects in Next.js for a while, and the same thing always happened to me, after using `npx create-next-app@latest` I had to start deleting files, creating others, deleting the default code and so on.

So, I decided to take the time to create this simple but useful script that allows me to create a Next.js application in JavaScript or TypeScript, with CSS or Tailwind.
And once created, it sorts, deletes and rewrites the files for me, saving me a couple of minutes when creating a new application.
